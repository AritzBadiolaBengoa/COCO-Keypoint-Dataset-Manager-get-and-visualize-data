# Getting and visualizing data from SVHN and COCO datasets

[SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) and [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#keypoints-2017) are 2 of the most used dataset for solving different Computer Vision problems.

SVHN is a dataset focused in the training and testing of number detection systems.

COCO is a dataset used for different challenges, but in this example, we are focusing in the task of keypoint detection.

The project has been developed using *Jupyter Notebook*. 

## Installation
